# WebCrawling-Allergies
Use Python and its associated libraries to webcrawl and get details of allergies from websites on the internet.
Initially, we use test.py to collect all the necessary links from the website "http://research.bmh.manchester.ac.uk/informall/allergenic-foods/" and put all the links that we scraped from the web page into test.csv . Later we use main.py file to execute the actual data scraping, where we visit all the links we collected earlier and scrape the data about allergies, allergens etc and neatly present them in data.csv file.
