"Shrimp, greasyback shrimp",Metapenaeus ensis,,Met e 1,,Major,PfamPF00261; Tropomyosin family,Yes,,"Reese et al. (1997) [1577] determined the sequence of Pen a 1, the tropomyosin fromFarfantepenaeus aztecus. They showed that the 30 DNA substitutions only resulted in a single amino acid substitution. The tryptic peptides reported by Shanti et al. (1993) [1576] fromFenneropenaeus indicusincluded 4 amino acid substitutions in 150 residues. Thus penaeoid shrimp tropomysins are likely to be immunologically almost identical.DeWitt et al. (2004) [1536] report that the level of sequence identity of tropomyosins with Pen a 1 is 99% for lobster (Homarus americanus), 92% for crab (Charybdis feriatus), 78-82% for insects and dust mites, 71% for a nematode (Caenorhabditis elegans) and 57% for both blue muscle (Mytilus edulis) and human, suggesting that IgE cross-reactivity is very likely for the invertebrate tropomysosins. Leung et al (1998) [1554] had earlier reported similar levels of amino acid identity for crab Cha f 1, Met e 1, lobster Pan s 1 and Hom a 1 andHomarus americanusslow muscle, fruit fly and chicken tropomyosins.DeWitt et al. (2004) [1536] also showed specific IgE binding to recombinant Pen a 1 and seven invertebrate extracts with 9 sera. 6 sera bound extracts from crustacea most strongly, 2 bound dust mite extract more strongly and one serum showed similar binding with both extracts. rPen a 1 bound 94% of the IgE from the 6 crustacea specific sera and gave 50% inhibition of the binding of extracts at about 0.1 Âµg/ml.Ayuso et al. (2002) [1543] investigated the binding of IgE to the sequences from other invertebrates related to the epitopes identified by Ayuso et al. (2002) [1545]. The epitope sequences were >90% identical between crustaceans, mites and cockroach. These epitopes were also reported to be related to those found in Pen i 1 fromFenneropenaeus indicus(Shanti et al. 1993 [1576]). However, the epitopes identified from oyster (Ishiwara et al. 1998 [1584]) and horned turban (Ishiwara et al. 1998 [1582]) were different. Ayuso et al. (2002) [1543] suggest that, in general, 2 amino acid substitutions in an epitope removes IgE binding.Leung et al (1996) [1557] used sera from 9 shrimp allergic patients and tested for cross-reactivity on immunoblots. As well as all arthropods (crustacea and insects), IgE binding was seen with all 9 sera to tropomyosins from gastropods: abalone (Haliotis diveriscolor) and whelk (Hemifusus ternatana), bivalves: mussel (Perna viridis), pen shell (Pinna atropupurea), scallop, oyster (Crassostrea gigas) and clam (Lutraria philipinarum) and cephalopods: cuttlefish (Sepia madokai), squid (Loligo edulis) and octopus ((Octopus luteus). None of the sera bound to either chicken or mouse tropomyosin. Reese et al. (1996) [1560] also reported that porcine, bovine and rabbit tropomyosins did not bind IgE.Leung et al (1998) [1555] demonstrated that allergy to both spiny lobster and American lobster (Panulirus stimpsoniandHomarus americanus) was due to tropomyosins and that preincubation of sera with the recombinant shrimp tropomyosin Met e 1 removed their IgE reactivity to lobster muscle extracts.As allergy to crustacea is dominated by reactions to the tropomysosins, clinical data on cross-reactivity and studies on IgE binding to extracts is also informative. Fernandez et al. (2003) [1539] demonstrated IgE binding and SPT reactivity in subjects sensitised by insect and mite allergens without prior exposure to shrimp.In contrast to the extensive observed cross-reactivity in IgE binding, clinical cross-reactivity is less common and some but not all crustacea allergics can tolerate mollusks (Leung et al (1996) [1557]; Ishiwara et al. 1998 [1584]; Ishiwara et al. 1998 [1582]).",,"Leung et al (1998) [1555] report the production of recombinant Met e 1.Naqpal et al (1989) [1572] purified two heat-stable allergens, designated as Sa-I and Sa-II, from boiled shrimp (Fenneropenaeus indicus) extracts.

"Shrimp, brown shrimp",Farfantepenaeus aztecus,,Pen a 1,,Major,PfamPF00261; Tropomyosin family,Yes,,"The nucleotide sequence of Pen a 1 shows 30 DNA substitutions compared to that of Met e 1, which only result in a single amino acid substitution (Reese et al, 1997 [1577]). The tryptic peptides reported by Shanti et al. (1993) [1576] fromFenneropenaeus indicusincluded 4 amino acid substitutions in 150 residues. Thus penaeoid shrimp tropomysins are likely to be immunologically almost identical.DeWitt et al. (2004) [1536] report that the level of sequence identity of tropomyosins with Pen a 1 is 99% for lobster (Homarus americanus), 92% for crab (Charybdis feriatus), 78-82% for insects and dust mites, 71% for a nematode (Caenorhabditis elegans) and 57% for both blue muscle (Mytilus edulis) and human, suggesting that IgE cross-reactivity is very likely for the invertebrate tropomysosins. Leung et al (1998) [1554] had earlier reported similar levels of amino acid identity for crab Cha f 1, Met e 1, lobster Pan s 1 and Hom a 1 andHomarus americanusslow muscle, fruit fly and chicken tropomyosins.DeWitt et al. (2004) [1536] also showed specific IgE binding to recombinant Pen a 1 and seven invertebrate extracts with 9 sera. 6 sera bound extracts from crustacea most strongly, 2 bound dust mite extract more strongly and one serum showed similar binding with both extracts. rPen a 1 bound 94% of the IgE from the 6 crustacea specific sera and gave 50% inhibition of the binding of extracts at about 0.1 Âµg/ml.Ayuso et al. (2002) [1543] investigated the binding of IgE to the sequences from other invertebrates related to the epitopes identified by Ayuso et al. (2002) [1545]. The epitope sequences were >90% identical between crustaceans, mites and cockroach. These epitopes were also reported to be related to those found in Pen i 1 fromFenneropenaeus indicus(Shanti et al. 1993 [1576]). However, the epitopes identified from oyster (Ishiwara et al. 1998 [1584]) and horned turban (Ishiwara et al. 1998 [1582]) were different. Ayuso et al. (2002) [1543] suggest that, in general, 2 amino acid substitutions in an epitope removes IgE binding.Leung et al (1996) [1557] used sera from 9 shrimp allergic patients and tested for cross-reactivity on immunoblots. As well as all arthropods (crustacea and insects), IgE binding was seen with all 9 sera to tropomyosins from gastropods: abalone (Haliotis diveriscolor) and whelk (Hemifusus ternatana), bivalves: mussel (Perna viridis), pen shell (Pinna atropupurea), scallop, oyster (Crassostrea gigas) and clam (Lutraria philipinarum) and cephalopods: cuttlefish (Sepia madokai), squid (Loligo edulis) and octopus ((Octopus luteus). None of the sera bound to either chicken or mouse tropomyosin. Reese et al. (1996) [1560] also reported that porcine, bovine and rabbit tropomyosins did not bind IgE.Leung et al (1998) [1555] demonstrated that allergy to both spiny lobster and American lobster (Panulirus stimpsoniandHomarus americanus) was due to tropomyosins and that preincubation of sera with the recombinant shrimp tropomyosin Met e 1 removed their IgE reactivity to lobster muscle extracts.As allergy to crustacea is dominated by reactions to the tropomysosins, clinical data on cross-reactivity and studies on IgE binding to extracts is also informative. Fernandez et al. (2003) [1539] demonstrated IgE binding and SPT reactivity in subjects sensitised by insect and mite allergens without prior exposure to shrimp.In contrast to the extensive observed cross-reactivity in IgE binding, clinical cross-reactivity is less common and some but not all crustacea allergics can tolerate mollusks (Leung et al (1996) [1557]; Ishiwara et al. 1998 [1584]; Ishiwara et al. 1998 [1582]).",,"Daul et al (1994) [1563] purified Pen a 1 from brown shrimp by SDS-PAGE.De Witt et al. (2004) [1536] expressed recombinant Pen a 1 in E. coli. Hexahistidine-tagged rPen a 1 was purified by immobilized-metal affinity chromatography (IMAC), using nickel charged chelating Sepharose HP packed in a XK50/20 column (Amersham Biosciences) and size exclusion chromatography (SEC), using a Superdex 200 XK50/100 column (Amersham Biosciences).De Witt et al. (2004) [1536] also purified native tropomyosin from finely chopped tail muscle ofPandalus borealisboiled for 10 min in 1 mL of distilled water per gram of tissue. After clarification by centrifugation and sequential passage through 1.2 µm and 0.45 µm mixed cellulose ester filters, the resulting extract was subjected to ultrafiltration using a PM-10 membrane (molecular mass cut-off: 10000 Da; Millipore). The retentate after ultrafiltration was applied to a Q Sepharose FF ion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 and eluted with a linear 0–0.5 M NaCl gradient in the same buffer. Fractions containing strong 38 kDa band by SDS-PAGE were pooled for further purification by SEC as described above.Leung et al (1998) [1555] report the production of recombinant Met e 1.Naqpal et al (1989) [1572] purified two heat-stable allergens, designated as Sa-I and Sa-II, from boiled shrimp (Fenneropenaeus indicus) extracts. Sa-I was isolated by ultrafiltration, Sephadex G-25, and diethylaminoethyl-Sephacel chromatography and gave a single band on SDS-PAGE at 8.2 kDa. Sa-II was purified by successive chromatography on diethylaminoethyl-Sephacel, Bio-Gel P-200, and Sepharose 4B columns. It gave a singe band at 34 kDa on SDS-PAGE. Shanti et al. (1993) [1576] showed that Sa-II was a tropomysosin and Sa-I a fragment of Sa-II."
